        Hello,

I am looking to rent out my room from Aug- 8-Sept 1. 700 per week but discounted for multiple weeks. If you need an earlier date we can work something out.

Apt:
2 bedroom, 1 bath on the second floor of a pre-war building. Bedrooms are located on opposite sides of the apartment. Apt is not large but not small. Well, the kitchen is small. But it has a dishwasher so that makes up for like..everything. Room is about 8x13 with a closet, 2 windows, queen size bed, and an AC unit. Pics to come. No cable but good wi-fi. Also, have access to my bike and helmet.

Location:
I am located in a great section of Park Slope, Brooklyn. Near..well..everything. F,R,G Subway is 3 blocks away and you can get into the city in 30min or less. There are bars, restaurants, laundry (meters away with free pick up and delivery), farmers market, prospect park, banks, great bagel places and more.

My roommate is a 20 something gay male, very laid back and general no drama guy. He works at night so hes home during the day. He has a dog (70lbs), that does shed, but hes a great friendly dog.

I am asking for 700 a week (plus 1 week deposit to be returned at the end of your stay), I would ideally have 1 person for all 3 weeks. 

Negotiable.

        I am subletting my furnished bedroom in a two bedroom duplex for the month of August.  My female roommate lives on the top floor which has it's own toilet, and will be traveling often in August.  When she is in town, she's at work the majority of the time, so you would essentially have the entire floor (including living room and kitchen) to yourself.  

Apartment is in East Village / Lower East Side, steps away from parks, trains, busses and citibike.  Awesome block filled with trendy and affordable restaurants, bars and grocery stores.   Apartment itself features high ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, modern appliances, 60 inch flatscreen tv, FIOS cable and wifi internet, and AC in all rooms.  Bedroom itself is furnished with full size bed, closet and desk with computer and printer.  Unit also has it's own private roof deck with lounge chairs and grill, great for laying out.

Room is available August 7 to Sept 1st and rent is $450 a week, utilities included.  If you need to get in sooner, we can certainly work something out.   Will be showing tomorrow Friday 7/25, please contact for an appointment

The room is in a ground floor apartment in the east village and costs $1275/mo including all utilities. The apartment is 4br with full kitchen/dishwasher and a large private outdoor area (shared with only one other apartment).

The nightlife and restaurant life around here is amazing! You will never run out of places to eat, bars to check out, and things to do. The apartment is conveniently located right around the block from 24/7 Grocery, less than a block to a laundromat, and a few blocks to Tompkins Square Park. It's very easy to get around the city from here as well. The M15 bus (going up and down 1st Ave) is a 4 min walk, the F train is 5 min, F/M/J are 8 min, L is 8 min.

        Room available in a 3BR second floor walk up 2 minutes from j/m/z trains. No joke. Yes that is it in the window. ~10/15 min from the L & G, close to major bus routes to get to downtown BK. Any business you could need is nearby. Bed, desk, AC, nail polish if you want it :) No closet but there's a slatwall & tall mirrored shelf unit, plenty of room to hang/store your clothes. No cat ;(

Roommates are two female friends from college, but everyone spends a lot more time out than in. If you're chill about most things besides dishes in the sink, ok with a train lullaby, have a job and/or a few side projects, you'd be a great fit.

Asking 750 for the month including utilities - I am gone from Aug 12 - Sept 12, but can be out earlier/later & if you only need a week or two or are on the fence re: the rate, just ask.

        Room available August 1 for short or longterm sublet.

One of our roommates is leaving New York so we're looking for someone to move into our great apartment in Prospect Heights. Location is ideal, just a few blocks from the Brooklyn Museum, Library, Grand Army Plaza and Prospect Park. Tons of restaurants and bars around, short walk to the 2 or 3 train at Eastern Parkway. 

The room is fully furnished with a queen size bed and dress. It's quite spacious with a window and two closets. You'll share the apartment with two other roommates - two males in their mid-twenties. We keep the common areas very neat. We both work long hours during the week, rarely home during the day. Definitely social on the weekends... our weekend brunches are no joke!

        Hi!

I have a great two bedroom apartment in the East Village - exposed brick, hardwood floor, stainless steel appliances, AC window unit, and VERY CLEAN. It's a 2 minute walk away from the L, right in front of the crosstown bus route that runs along 14th Street, and a fifteen minute walk from Union Sq and the LES bar scene. I'm hoping to sublet my room for August and you'd share the place with my very quiet, clean, and respectful roommate.

I could prorate, but for the entire month it would be about 1400, utilities included. The room has a closet, AC, and I can leave my bed with sheets if needed.

Thanks!

        Hello, 

I have an open furnished room in my apartment starting August 1st.  Rent is $1,150/month + 1/2 of utilities. I'm open to short or long-term depending on the person. Below is more information about the room. If you're interested, please be in touch and tell me a little bit about yourself. If it's a good fit, I'll send you pictures and more info.

Not open to couples (sorry!) or people who want to "trade" :)

Happy Hunting!

******
Furnished 1 bedroom in a 2 bedroom quiet, railroad apartment (with separate entrances) on the Upper East Side.

Rent is $1150/mo. + 1/2 of utilities + one month security deposit ($1,150).

This two-bedroom in a 4th floor walk up in the East 80s is on a tree-lined street. The apartment has a living room, large/recently renovated eat-in kitchen (with dishwasher!) and one bathroom. The bedroom is approximately 12 x 9 with a 9 x 4 alcove, so it comfortably fits a bed and several other pieces of furniture. Currently, there's a bed and small dresser in the room. Also, there's an air conditioner which will be essential during the hot, sticky summer months. The bedroom also has 1 closet and shares a large hall closet. Close to the express train at 86th Street, restaurants, bars, stores, Carl Schurz Park, and Central Park. 

A little bit about me, I'm in my mid-30's and have been in the city for about 4 and half years. I came to NYC to go to graduate school a little over four years ago. I do freelance consulting so I work from home. I like to keep the apartment clean but I'm not OCD. I'm progressive and considerate. I'm looking for someone who is similar and understands how to share space with others.

Laundry is about a 5 minute walk away. There's a grocery store - a proper store, not a bodega - on the corner. Fairway is a few blocks away.

        We are looking to sublet one of four bedrooms starting August 15 through to first week of Nov. Real bedroom, no fake walls or doors.  Since I will be returning to the apartment I can leave my bed, dresser, cabinets, citibike key (you would just need to enter your credit card info).  This is ideal for someone looking for a semi permanent place - there is a possibility that you would be able to stay past November if I'm still traveling for work.

The building is a walk up above a great row of restaurants and a few blocks away from Fairway, AMC Movie Theater, Crunch/NYSC, multiple CitiBike stations and endless Murray Hill bar and restaurants on 3rd.  
It's 10 steps from the crosstown express bus for easy access to any subway line & Penn station/PATH.  We're also very close to the 4,5,6 line (approx 3-5 minute walk) and grand central (10 min walk).

We are great mix of guys in our 20's - we work in culinary, marketing and finance. We are good friends and get along really well if you are new to the city this would be a great place to get settled in before finding a more permanent place.

Rent is $1,250/month - with first and last month upfront. As mentioned we are looking for someone who can stay through until November. Please introduce yourself if you are interested in viewing the apartment and indicate which days around 7pm you are able to stop by. Girls and Guys welcome to apply - please include a social media link so we know you're real.

Thanks!

        Hello there,

I'm looking for someone to rent a small but sweet room in my loft with a minimum commitment of 6 months with the potential for something long term.  It's available starting August 1st. Along with the room is a large desk/work space in the common area of the loft.  I would be your only other roommate, along with my cat, Bondo.  The loft is spacious, clean, quiet and welcoming.  It's in a great building with respectful and nice neighbors. 

About your room/desk: 
It comes with a twin bed, clothes rack, side table and lamp. There is no window to the outside, but there is a window into the common space that has tons of sunlight.  The desk space is in the common space with an accompanying filing cabinet for storage, etc.  

About the building:
It's a huge old loft building that was at one time a sweater factory. It is managed by the best landlord in NYC (in my opinion!) and is very clean and safe.  There is laundry on every floor, elevators, and rooftop access.

About the neighborhood:
It's a growing residential nook of Bed-Stuy on the edge of Clinton Hill with an industrial edge.  There is a huge grocery store downstairs as well as coffee shops and restaurants within reasonable  walking distance. Pratt University is just down the street, so there are students milling about.

About me:
I teach yoga and am an artist. I'm vegetarian and hope that you are too!  I keep the space really clean and have a rather quiet lifestyle when at home. I don't play loud music or watch loud tv. I don't drink in excess or do drugs.  

About you:
You are motivated, respectful, clean, reasonably quiet and like to pay your rent on time! You aren't allergic to cats and if I'm really lucky you don't eat animals!

The price does not include utilities.  Expect to pay between $65-80/ month for WiFi + Electric. Please tell me a little bit about yourself in your response. I'll be showing the space starting July 19th.
I look forward to meeting you!

        Hi!

COME SEE OUR APARTMENT THIS WEEK!

My name is Blake, I am 28 (female) and originally from the Bay Area. I have a really lovely four bedroom apartment in Clinton Hill, and am currently looking for a subletter/roommate for one of the rooms beginning AUGUST 1ST (Minimum 3 month sublet). People often remark that the space feels more like a home than an apartment, and likewise I am looking for someone who is seeking a home-like environment! I see this apartment as a place to make the most of life in Brooklyn, whether its having friends over for an impromptu dinner party, movie night or BBQ or heading out to one of a number of local restaurants or bars, or spending the day at nearby Prospect Park or the Botanic Gardens. It is ideally situated in Clinton Hill, adjacent to Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, Crown Heights and Bed Stuy. Its a straight shot up Classon Ave. to Williamsburg and Greenpoint.

The apartment itself was gut renovated just before I moved in almost 2 years. It has hard wood floors throughout, 11 foot ceilings, glass-paned french doors that separate the living room and dining room (which is outfitted with a record player and sound system), TWO new bathrooms and a modern kitchen which we have appointed with a plethora of appliances (Blendtec Blender, Breville Juicer, Toaster Oven, Waffle Iron, Water Kettle, French Press, etc). Whether your a seasoned cook or a novice, you'll have everything you need! The apartment also has private outdoor space with lawn, table, chairs and grill! 

The room itself is very good sized. It has a large closet with sweater shelf, above closet storage, dimer lights and more power outlets than one person could possibly need. 

My boyfriend and I live here together with his cat, Catfriend and we have two existing subletters who are both wonderful, dynamic people with their own busy independent lives. We are all in our mid/late 20s. I am looking for a like-minded individual who appreciates a well-appointed home and a stress-free home life.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, or to schedule a time to come by!

Best, 
Blake

        Sublet my room and attached studio in a giant cooperative community house! 
Mid-August through October 31st (start date is negotiable)
Contact me to arrange a time to view the house and meet the housemates

THE HOUSE
Our community house has a massive amount of space including a large kitchen and dining room, living room, huge yard, porch, laundry, six bathrooms, several common areas and a large basement. It is located in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, close to the C and G lines.

THE HOUSEMATES
We are, collectively: nerds, queers, activists, artists, teachers, professors, students, bike mechanics, caregivers, change-makers, organizers, cooks, cyclists, programmers, designers, bookkeepers, foodies, grocers, musicians and more. We currently range in age from 25-37 and come from varied backgrounds. 

There are 3 cats living in the house and sometimes a dog or two will visit.

AVAILABLE ROOM (9 ft x 11 ft)
The available room is located on the first floor. It is furnished with a full size bed and dresser, has two large windows, high ceilings, a closet, and an air conditioner. There is a private foyer for the room where you can keep your shoes, coats, and sandy beach bag. The room is located near a half bathroom (with two full baths on the floor/6 bathrooms in the house).

Attached (but with a door) is an artist studio/study! The studio has high ceilings, a window and skylight, couch, large desk, shelving, and open wall space. 

RENT
The full rent for room + studio per month:
$650 for the room
$300 for studio
$150 for all utilities + food (high speed internet and all utilities + food that is purchased for the house 2x per week/4 weekly communal dinners)

Total rent is $1100 per month (August rent will be prorated) 

COLLECTIVE LIVING
This is a unique living situation in NYC! As a part of your stay, grocery shopping will be done by your housemates and you will receive 4 house dinners a week! In exchange, you will have a weekly house chore and will cook 2 house meals a month. I think it is an awesome situation. I often get home late from work and find leftovers in the fridge or I can ask for a plate of food to be set aside to eat the following day. For a little bit of my time, I get supported by my housemates. We each give in a little and we get back a lot in return.

        I am going to be signing a lease for a four bedroom apartment in the financial district, at One West Street.  I will be moving in late August or early September, but the lease starts August 1st.  Consequentially, I am looking to sublet the room for the month of August for $1500, this is the monthly rate for the room under the official lease terms.  The three other kids are finance majors at NYU Stern and will be moving in August 1st as well.  

Ideally I would want someone to sublet the room for the entire month of August, however if you can only do a portion of the month then I would still consider you.

As I said, I am not moved in, so the room would be unfurnished.  However, I can speak with my roommates about potentially putting in a bed and other basic necessities.  

The building amenities are outstanding, coming with a fitness center, free wifi, and even complementary brunches every Sunday.  Further details and pictures can be found here: http://ocean1west.com 

Feel free to reach out to me via email or phone, whichever you feel more comfortable with doing.

Best,

Wyatt

Welcome home. 

Seeking a subletter for my bedroom in my 2- BR Upper East Side apartment from August 1st - 16th (exit dates can be negotiated as far as the 18th.) 

It's a choice location on E 66th St., just a few blocks over from Central Park. It's a wonderful, safe area right near a Gristedes, Food emporium, TJ Maxx, Bed Bath & Beyond, and all kinds of fantastic restaurants and bars. The 4/5/6, F and the N/Q/R are a short walk away.

The apartment is small but cozy, fully furnished, with a dishwasher, and washer/dryer right in the apartment (basically unheard of.) 

My room has its own AC unit, and my bed is lofted (there's a fan up there too for the summer months) so you'll have your own private couch with a pull-down desk for watching movies if you prefer alone time. Bonus: we also have an open rooftop if you'd like to catch some sun!

You'd be living with my fantastic, laid back lady roommate (who works from about 7 AM to around 7 PM every night), and 1 very cute & cuddly tortie kitten by the name of Eva.

I'm asking for $1,000, wifi & utilities included. 
[That's $62 bucks a night, folks. Hard to beat.]

Only the first month's rent and $400 deposit needed.  Sooo...$1690.00 total needed to move in.  Rent includes wifi, utilities, and weekly cleaning service.

Room includes a large loft bed frame & ladder.  Would fit a queen mattress.  Current roommates are social but chill.  They have friends over for dinner and go out on the weekends but nothing too crazy.  Just to throw this out there...It is still the famous "McKibbin Lofts" so some nights do get a little wild in the building and the walls are not soundproof.  Definitely a building full of life and character.

Located very close to the L-train.  (Between the Montrose and Morgan stops)  Awesome bars and local restaurants all around.  Always something going on and tons of people to meet!

We have 4 rooms left that are available, so you can pick and choose. Additionally, we're also looking for one more person to be on the lease.

We're seeking (shoes off at the door style) artistic, vivid, clean, responsible, drama and drug free people (420 excluded), no smoking in the space, but there's a roof top to enjoy.
Its a great chance to live among an influx of creative people to increase you network! No pets, and no smoking... sorry.

Short term or long term is totally fine with us (e.g. 4 months to 1 year or more)

The loft is a duplex that was fully renovated, so everything is brand new, with dual insulated walls providing a great since of privacy, two common spaces, two bathrooms and two separate entrances on the upper and lower floor. New hardwood floors, large living room and a decked out stainless steel kitchen. 24 hour roof access with amazing views, laundry on the premises, bike storage, 24 hour management and security. Peep the Pics.

Room 4: $1000 That easily fits a full size bed, with room left over and high ceilings.


In the heart of Bushwick. One block off the Morgan L Stop (Bogart Exit), we're right in the heart of the busiest part of the neighborhood. 7 minutes to the heart of Williamsburg and 10 minutes to Union Square.

Exit the building and be surrounded by vintage shops, a health food and vitamin stores, local bodegas, a cool little park, three yoga studios, two gyms, three coffee shops, a wine store, and of course, many dive and metal bars, music venues, tons of art galleries and events and restaurants. Does Roberta's Pizza ring a bell? No worries if not, I'll sure you'll try and love it!

        I am moving out of my current 2 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment and need to sublet my room in a new central air-conditioned/heated, doorman building in Bushwick.  

It's a 10 min walk from the Morgan L train, two blocks from the Central Ave M train, or 10 minute walk from the J/Z at Myrtle Ave. The building also has a nice roof, gym, game room, bike storage and laundry. The room is very big with a generous closet, hardwood floors, and stainless steel appliances with the option of coming fully furnished. The roommate is a 27 year old male. He is nice, Syracuse grad, sports enthusiast, and is cool with guy or girl roommate.

Rent is $1175/ month with one month security deposit and a $50 sublet credit check fee.  Utilities are split.

I just resigned my lease for a year beginning August 1st so the sublet is ideally for one year, but open to shorter term.

        One bedroom available for 4 months starting August 2nd (date flexible) until November 30th (possible lease extension through May). It is a private bedroom in a 2 bedroom apartment with shared bathroom and kitchen/living area.

Apartment: The apartment gets incredible natural light all day long, has exposed brick, and is on the 3rd floor of a walk-up. It was newly renovated when we moved in, and has all new kitchen appliances. Landlord and building manager are responsive and friendly. The apartment is located in Prospect/Crown Heights off of Eastern Parkway and Franklin Ave. On one side of the block is the Brooklyn Museum and Prospect Park and on the other side, (literally around the corner), is the 2/3/4/5/S Franklin Ave. subway stop. If you're not familiar with the neighborhood, it is quickly up-and-coming with lots of young adults moving in as well as bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and little stores popping up.  Both my favorite pizza and burger place in the whole city are in this neighborhood! There's a farmer's market on Saturdays at Grand Army Plaza. Atlantic/Barclays Center is a 35 minute walk away if you feel like taking a stroll.

Room: The available room is the slightly smaller one, but still plenty of room (estimated 9x14)! It has one window, a brick wall, and great closet. The rent is $875/month (we got this price because we signed in the dead of winter!). Internet, gas, and electric bills are split down the middle making the monthly bill around $65 per person on average. 

Roommate: You will get to live with my sweet, friendly roommate who is a graduate student in her twenties that moved here from South Africa. She stays pretty busy with work and school, but keeps normal hours, is quiet, friendly, and neat, and is always up for a chat when we are both home! I'm the most sad to leave her. :')

You: FEMALES ONLY. Looking for someone who is friendly, responsible, employed, and clean. You absolutely must pay rent/bills on time. No smoking, heavy drinking, or pets. No live-in boyfriends or parties. My roommate is the sweetest, and I'm only accepting an equally sweet roommate for her. : )

To move in you'll need first months rent and security ($900), and to simply meet the landlord (he's nice!). To come see the apartment Friday, Saturday, or Sunday morning/afternoon, please reply to this post with details about yourself and when you're wanting to move in.

        Bedroom available August 1st in a fabulous loft space that's located a three minute walk from both the Morgan and Montrose L stops. 

The loft has two floors connected by a spiral staircase. The bedroom in question is in the quiet back corner of the upper floor, with windows facing the street, a built-in shelving unit, a bench, high ceilings, and great lighting. There's a lofted area for a bed. All furniture can remain in the bedroom, including my mattress if you need it. I can also move it, if you want an empty space. 

The apartment has a recently renovated enormous kitchen, a washer and dryer, two full bathrooms, fourteen-foot ceilings, and five charming roommates (you shall be the sixth). Though we are indeed in the legendary McKibbin building, we're quite clean and functional, and no, we do not have bed bugs. We all get along wonderfully and are respectful of the shared space, and we're hoping to find someone who is easy-going and fun, but tidy and mature. The building has an amazing rooftop that's always accessible. 

Asking price for the room is $950 with utilities included. Couples are welcome, but you'll be paying more like $1150 with utilities included. One month security deposit required. A three month sublet is ideal, but if you need it for only one month, or two, or four, or whatever, we can talk about it. 

Please respond via email with your name, age, occupation, and Facebook link if you don't mind. 

Thanks!
